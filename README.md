This repository is part of Schema Driven Configuration (SDC)

The paradigm of schema-driven API approaches is gaining increasing popularity as it facilitates programmatic interaction with systems by both machines and humans. While OpenAPI schema stands out as a widely embraced system, there are other notable schema approaches like YANG, among others. This project endeavors to empower users with a declarative and idempotent method for seamless interaction with API systems, providing a robust foundation for effective system configuration."
